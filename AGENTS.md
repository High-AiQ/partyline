# AGENTS.md

Guidance for coding agents working in this repository.

## What this is

partyline is a local chatroom that attaches real interactive processes to conversations through
ptys. Read `README.md` first. The pty and transcript-tailing design are load-bearing: do not
replace an interactive process with a headless invocation or screen scraping.

## Layout

- `partyline/server.py` — FastAPI app: REST, WebSocket, and mention routing
- `partyline/adapters/` — built-in process adapters and adapter discovery
- `partyline/db.py` — SQLite schema, migrations, and queries
- `partyline/static/index.html` — frontend (vanilla JavaScript; no build step)
- `skills/add-process-adapter/` — procedure and contract for new adapters

## Run and test

```bash
uv run partyline
PARTYLINE_DB=/tmp/partyline-test.db PARTYLINE_PORT=8643 uv run partyline
```

Always test with a throwaway database and port, never a person's normal local database. Use an
inexpensive, short-running test configuration. Keep secrets in `.env` and pass any test-only
credentials only to the process command; never add them to shell profiles, source, or commits.

**Never `pkill -f partyline`** (or any pattern matching a port or the project name). It matches
the instance hosting the conversation you are in, and it matches your own shell's command line.
Find the process that owns the port and kill that pid:

```bash
ss -ltnp | grep 8643        # → users:(("partyline",pid=NNNNN,...))
kill NNNNN
```

## Working on partyline from inside partyline

This project is developed through a running copy of itself, so a careless restart drops every
participant in the room — including whoever is doing the work. The rules that make that safe:

- **The instance hosting the conversation is never the checkout being edited.** Run the
  *cockpit* from its own clone at a known-good commit; edit the *workbench* checkout. An agent
  that edits the code its own line is running has no way to load its own fix.
- **Test on a throwaway port and database**, one per person, so several agents can test at once
  without colliding: `PARTYLINE_DB=/tmp/<you>.db PARTYLINE_PORT=864x uv run partyline`.
- **Restarting the cockpit is a scheduled act, not a side effect.** Announce it, let everyone
  commit and post status, then restart and resume. Uncommitted work in an agent's head does not
  survive; committed work always does, and chat history is replayed from SQLite on resume.
- **Adapter changes do not need a restart** — `POST /api/adapters/reload` re-executes adapter
  packages in place. Changes to the base class, loader, server, or frontend do.
- Prefer changes that make a restart cheaper (resume support, adopting live attachments,
  liveness reporting) over changes that assume restarts are rare.

## Adapter rules

- One bundled adapter package lives at `partyline/adapters/bundled/<id>/` and has a manifest
  (`adapter.toml`) plus an entrypoint (`adapter.py` defining `PartylineAdapter`).
- Prefer tailing the process's structured transcript or log. Never post raw terminal-screen
  contents as chat messages. A raw stream may be quiescence-flushed only for intentionally
  stream-based adapters.
- A transcript must be located unambiguously. If the CLI can be told which session id or session
  directory to use, pin it; if discovery has to fall back to matching on working directory and
  start time, the adapter must also *claim* the file it resolves, so a second attachment in the
  same directory cannot latch onto the first one's transcript and repost its messages.
- Anything injected into a pty must assume a person may be typing: use bracketed paste and
  then Enter.
- Keep discovery, manifest validation, import, and reload behavior compatible with external
  adapter repositories. See `skills/add-process-adapter/SKILL.md` before changing this surface.

## Data and releases

- Put schema changes in idempotent entries in `MIGRATIONS`; do not edit an already-applied
  schema definition.
- Use one-line Conventional Commits: `type(scope): subject`. Types are `feat`, `fix`, `docs`,
  `refactor`, `test`, and `chore`.
- Versioning is semver, single-sourced from `partyline/__init__.py`. Bump in the same commit:
  feature → minor, fix → patch, breaking change → major. Documentation, test, refactor, and
  chore changes do not bump the version.
